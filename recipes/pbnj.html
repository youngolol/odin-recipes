    <h1>Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../images/pbnj.jpg">

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>In fifth grade, my teacher, Ms. Murray, assigned us a project where we had to write out 
        a recipe on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She took every student's assignment 
        and followed them to a tee. Of course, mine was up next, but wasn't nearly as descriptive as she
        wanted considering that she executed each step literally. To "put peanut butter on bread" for her 
        meant taking the whole jar and putting it on top of her closed loaf of bread.</p>
        
    <p>Anyways, here's my recipe update (over 18 years later), featuring your favorite childhood(and adulthood) snack, 
        the peanut butter and jelly sandwich...but with a twist!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>bread</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>flaky salt</li>
        <li>jam preserves (from fruit of your choosing)</li>
        <li>nut butter (crunchy preferable)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan to medium-heat</li>
        <li>Butter both sides of two slices of bread</li>
        <li>When pan is hot, grill both sides of both slices of bread until nicely browned</li>
        <li>Allow bread to cool for 2-3min until warm to touch</li>
        <li>Spread 1-2 tablespoons of peanut butter on one side of one slice and the same for the other slice with the preserves</li>
        <li>Cut in half then sprinkle top, to taste, with flaky salt</li>
    </ol>
