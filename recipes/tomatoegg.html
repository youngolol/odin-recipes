    <h1>Chinese Tomato Egg Stir-Fry</h1>
    <img src="../images/tomatoegg.jpg">

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Right at the height of COVID lockdowns, I was living out of a small town in Norther California, just beyond San Francisco, with a Chinese family.
        I was working on a contract, and found a spare room within their home. Although I was there a short time, and despite there being a bit of a language 
        barrier between us, I learned quite a lot about the family through cooking! One of the first things they taught me to make was tomato egg; I think 
        what I was really drawn to beyond the great flavor combination, was just the simplicity of the dish to make on my "lazy" nights.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (to feed 1-2)</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>3 small tomatoes (I find that roma's are nice for this dish)</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 green onion (finely sliced)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>3-4 tbp neutral oil</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tomatoes into small wedges (usually sixths)</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, with the shaoxing wine, until homogenous and yolks blended well into the whites</li>
        <li>Preheat pan over medium heat then add 1/2 neutral oil</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, and scramble for approximately 1-1.5min
             (eggs should be runny between completely cooked and liquid)
        </li>
        <li>Remove eggs from pan into another plate or bowl</li>
        <li>Add the other half of the oil and then the garlic to cook until aromatic (not burnt)</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and cook for 3min or until medium soft</li>
        <li>Add eggs and white pepper and mix together</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and then green onions as garnish</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
